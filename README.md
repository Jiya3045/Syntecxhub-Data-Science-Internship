# NumPy Data Explorer

## Project Description
This project demonstrates the fundamentals of NumPy, a powerful Python library used for numerical computations. The notebook explores array creation, indexing, slicing, mathematical and statistical operations, reshaping, broadcasting, and performance comparison with Python lists.

## Topics Covered
- NumPy array creation
- Indexing and slicing
- Mathematical operations
- Statistical operations
- Axis-wise operations
- Reshaping and broadcasting
- Saving and loading NumPy arrays
- Performance comparison between NumPy arrays and Python lists

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the `numpy_data_explorer.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run each cell sequentially from top to bottom.
3. Observe the outputs for different NumPy operations.
